# BTXR_FF_Analytics

BTXR_FF_Analytics is a repo dedicated to Blocker Texas Ranger's fantasy football endevors using the ff_analytics() package and tools. 
I manange multiple teams every season and they often span a range of platforms. FF_Analytics will bring all the fantasy data available 
into a central platform for customized analysis. 

### What is here

What is found in this repo are plots and projections created each week, as well as scripts used to proform analysis specific to my
teams needs. File structure for projections will be sorted by league, season and week, with a scripts folder at parent level to hold 
analysis to be ran for all leagues.
